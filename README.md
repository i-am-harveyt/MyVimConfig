# My Minimal Vim Config file

This is my minimal vim and neovim config! Let WhichKey and NERDTree make my life easier.

## Before Started

Install VimPlug from [VimPlug Repo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), select Vim version. If you use neovim, install the one for neovim.

Make directory: `~/.config/vim/plugin`. If you use neovim , check if `~/.config/nvim/plugged/` is made.

## Quick Start

1. Open Vim

2. run command `:PlugInstall`, and wait for download.

3. Reopen your vim. Done!

## Features

The only feature is that, this can make your life a tiny little bit easier.

If your life is easy enough, you can say there's no feature. 

## Packages in this Config.

WhichKey: A great thing for people who don't(or cannot) remember commands like me.

NERDTree: A side bar that list all your files in this directory, you can also navigate in it, which makes your life easier.
